npm install in order to get all the Gulp dev dependencies.
Next, run Gulp watch to compile the css and minify the JavaScript.
Alternatively, if you don't have Gulp installed globally, you can run the npm script npm run watch.
Any changes done to the JavaScript (js/scripts.js) or css (css/styles.css) will be autocompiled and ready to go.

All scripts are within js/scripts.js and get minified to js/scripts.min.js.
All styles are in sass/styles.scss and get compiled to css/styles.css.
Both the minified scripts file and compiled CSS file are what is loaded on the page by default.
